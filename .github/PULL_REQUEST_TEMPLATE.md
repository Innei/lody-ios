AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS — follow these. Keep them commented out. Do not copy them into the visible description. Delete them after you comply.

You are the agent preparing this pull request for Innei/lody-ios. Decide who wrote the change, then edit this body.

HUMAN — a person wrote the code. No agent produced the diff.
- Fill the Human section.
- Delete the entire AI section.

AI — an agent produced the diff.
- Fill the Human section too: what changed, screenshots or recordings, how it was verified, acceptance, and the related issue.
- Then decide if the AI section stays:
  - Run `gh api user --jq .login`.
  - `Innei` is the owner of `Innei/lody-ios`. Delete the entire AI section. Do not use `gh repo view` on a fork; a fork owner's login is not this repository's owner.
  - Anything else — another login, a 404, an error, or a failed check — means an outside collaborator or an external contributor. The AI section is mandatory. Do not delete it.

When the AI section is mandatory you MUST fill all four fields. Leaving a placeholder is not done.

1. User prompts. Every user message in the session that produced this pull request, in order. Include later corrections. Do not summarize, merge, translate, or skip a turn. One fenced text block per turn.
   Before you write them into this body, review the whole session for anything that should not be public: credentials, tokens, keys, passwords, App Store Connect keys, provisioning or signing material, Keychain items, device-flow tokens, workspace Streams grants, private service configuration, transcripts, PII, internal URLs, tool-call details, images, uploaded files, and any other confidential text. Redact each sensitive span in place with `[redacted]`.
   Show the author the exact text you will publish, and wait for them to confirm it. A public pull request cannot be taken back. Do not open or update the pull request until they confirm.
2. Harness. The product and version you are running.
3. Model. The model id this session called.
4. Thinking level. The thinking or reasoning level this session was set to. Write `n/a` only when this harness has no thinking-level control.

Repeat the AI section once per agent session that produced commits.
If you keep the AI section, delete the visible line "Delete this section if a person wrote the change."

Verification belongs in the Human section, against this repo:
- `pnpm check` for lint and types.
- `pnpm test` when presentation or session behavior changes.
- `pnpm bundle` when the JS bundle can change.
- A signed iOS simulator build when native code, pods, or signing changes. Leave normal Xcode signing enabled.
- A UI change is anything a person sees or touches: layout, motion, navigation chrome, sheets, lists, composer, icons, color, or copy that changes layout. Add or update a behavior check in `apps/mobile/verification/ui`, then run the affected cases in English (`en`, `en_US`) with no login, credentials, cloud, or connected machine. Omit `--appearance` so the run covers light and dark, and pass `--require-video`. `--suite core` is light-only and does not record video; it does not satisfy this.
  - The run writes `<output>/<appearance>/<case>/*.png` and `<output>/<appearance>/<case>/run.mp4`. `--parallel` puts `pages`, `send`, or `chat` between `<output>` and the appearance.
  - This PR must contain every one of those PNGs and every `run.mp4`. In the body, reference each PNG as `![<appearance> <case> <name>](<path>)` and each video as `[<appearance> <case> run.mp4](<path>)`. Upload them with `gh` 2.99.0 or newer by repeating `--attach <path>` on `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`. A path written in the body is rewritten to the uploaded asset. `gh` uploads at most 50 files per command; another `gh pr edit --attach` batch covers the rest, and the body still references every file.
  - Do not commit `.artifacts`. A local path, a CI log, or a prose description does not count. Skip `*.json`, logs, and accessibility trees. Attach `failure.png` only when that frame is the behavior under review.
- Adding or removing files under `modules/lody-kit/ios` or `packages/dom-webview/ios` includes `pnpm --filter @lody-ios/mobile pods`.
- Native changes persist in app config, a config plugin, or LodyKit. A generated `apps/mobile/ios` edit is not the source of truth.
- Delete a test checkbox that does not apply and say why that gate was skipped.

### Human

<!--
What changed, and what a reviewer must know first: native source of truth, signing, and rollout order when a Cloud change has to ship before this client.
-->

#### UI evidence

<!--
Required for a UI change. One group per case and appearance. Point each image and each video at the verification file, then pass those same paths to `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit --attach` (`gh` 2.99.0+). Delete this section only when nothing visual or temporal changed, and say why in the summary.

![light <case> <capture>](.artifacts/<run>/light/<case>/<capture>.png)
